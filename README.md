# NetworkScanner
AI/ML-Enhanced Network Scanner

## Overview
This project enhances traditional network scanners with AI/ML capabilities to prioritize vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and provide automated reporting. By combining machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and optimized scanning workflows, this tool automates and improves vulnerability management, making it easier to identify and address critical security issues.

## Key Features
- **Prioritize Vulnerabilities**: Predict which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited using ML models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify zero-day threats or unusual network behavior that traditional scanners might miss.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate human-readable summaries of scan results using NLP.
- **Optimized Scanning**: Use reinforcement learning to schedule scans during low-traffic periods to minimize disruption.

## Technical Workflow
### 1. Data Collection
- **Sources**:
  - Network Scans: Gather data using tools like `nmap`, `OpenVAS`, or `Nessus`.
  - Vulnerability Databases: Fetch CVE details from the NVD API or CVE Details.
  - Network Traffic Logs: Capture flow data using tools like `CICFlowMeter`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - For prioritization: CVSS score, CVE age, affected software popularity, patch availability.
  - For anomaly detection: Packet size, protocol distribution, traffic volume.
- **Labeling**:
  - Use historical exploit data (e.g., Exploit-DB) to train supervised models.

### 3. Model Training
- **Prioritization Model**:
  - Algorithm: `XGBoost`, `Random Forest`, or Logistic Regression.
  - Input: Features like CVSS score, exploit availability, software usage statistics.
  - Output: Probability of exploitation (e.g., "Critical," "High," "Medium").
- **Anomaly Detection Model**:
  - Algorithm: Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, or One-Class SVM.
  - Input: Network traffic features (e.g., flow duration, bytes sent).
  - Output: Anomaly score (flag if above threshold).

### 4. Integration with Scanner
Use Python to integrate the ML models with scanning tools. Example workflow:
```python
import nmap
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Step 1: Run nmap scan
scanner = nmap.PortScanner()
scanner.scan('192.168.1.1', arguments='-sV')

# Step 2: Extract features (e.g., open ports, service versions)
features = {
    "port_22_open": 1 if '22' in scanner['192.168.1.1'].all_tcp() else 0,
    "service_http": 1 if 'http' in scanner['192.168.1.1'].services() else 0,
}

# Step 3: Load pre-trained model and predict risk
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.load('vuln_priority_model.pkl')
risk_level = model.predict(pd.DataFrame([features]))
print(f"Risk Level: {risk_level}")
```

### 5. Reporting & Visualization
- **NLP Summaries**:
  - Example: "Critical Risk: Port 22 (SSH) is open with an outdated OpenSSL version (CVE-2021-3449). Patch immediately."
- **Dashboard**:
  - Build using `Flask`/`Django` with `Plotly`/`Dash` to display risks and scan results visually.

## Tools & Libraries
| Component              | Tools                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Network Scanning**   | `nmap`, `OpenVAS`, `Scapy`              |
| **ML Frameworks**      | `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `TensorFlow` |
| **NLP**                | `spaCy`, `Hugging Face Transformers`    |

| **Datasets**           | `NVD`, `CICFlowMeter`                   |

## Example: Prioritization Model
### Training Workflow
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset (example)
data = pd.read_csv('cve_data.csv')
X = data[['cvss_score', 'days_since_patch', 'popularity_score']]
y = data['exploited']  # Binary label (1=exploited, 0=not)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
print(f"Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test)}")
```

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Imbalanced Data**: Use SMOTE oversampling or class weights.
- **False Positives**: Combine ML predictions with rule-based checks.
- **Scalability**: Use cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud) for large-scale scans.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Cybersecurity**: Network protocols, vulnerability management, CVE databases.
- **AI/ML**: Feature engineering, model evaluation, deployment.
- **Programming**: API integration, automation, tool scripting.

## Project Timeline
| Phase                        | Time (Part-Time) |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| Basic Network Scanner        | 1–2 weeks        |
| ML Model Integration         | 2–3 weeks        |
| Advanced Features (NLP)      | 1–2 weeks        |

## Why This Project?
- **Real-World Impact**: Automates tedious tasks like triaging vulnerabilities.
- **Portfolio-Ready**: Demonstrates full-stack skills (networking + AI + DevOps).
- **Career Relevance**: Prepares for roles like Security Engineer or Threat Intelligence Analyst.

## Next Steps
1. Start with a basic `nmap` scanner in Python.
2. Add a simple ML model (e.g., logistic regression) to prioritize CVEs.
3. Gradually integrate NLP and anomaly detection.
