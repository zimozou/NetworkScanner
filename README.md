# NetworkScanner
AI/ML-Enhanced Network Scanner

## Overview
This project enhances traditional network scanners with AI/ML capabilities to prioritize vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and provide automated reporting. By combining machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and optimized scanning workflows, this tool automates and improves vulnerability management, making it easier to identify and address critical security issues.

## Key Features
- **Prioritize Vulnerabilities**: Predict which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited using ML models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify zero-day threats or unusual network behavior that traditional scanners might miss.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate human-readable summaries of scan results using NLP.
- **Optimized Scanning**: Use reinforcement learning to schedule scans during low-traffic periods to minimize disruption.

## Technical Workflow
### 1. Data Collection
- **Sources**:
  - Network Scans: Gather data using tools like `nmap`, `OpenVAS`, or `Nessus`.
  - Vulnerability Databases: Fetch CVE details from the NVD API or CVE Details.
  - Network Traffic Logs: Capture flow data using tools like `CICFlowMeter`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - For prioritization: CVSS score, CVE age, affected software popularity, patch availability.
  - For anomaly detection: Packet size, protocol distribution, traffic volume.
- **Labeling**:
  - Use historical exploit data (e.g., Exploit-DB) to train supervised models.

### 3. Model Training
- **Prioritization Model**:
  - Algorithm: `XGBoost`, `Random Forest`, or Logistic Regression.
  - Input: Features like CVSS score, exploit availability, software usage statistics.
  - Output: Probability of exploitation (e.g., "Critical," "High," "Medium").
- **Anomaly Detection Model**:
  - Algorithm: Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, or One-Class SVM.
  - Input: Network traffic features (e.g., flow duration, bytes sent).
  - Output: Anomaly score (flag if above threshold).

### 4. Integration with Scanner
Use Python to integrate the ML models with scanning tools. 

### 5. Reporting & Visualization
- **NLP Summaries**:
  - Example: "Critical Risk: Port 22 (SSH) is open with an outdated OpenSSL version (CVE-2021-3449). Patch immediately."
